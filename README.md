# Shape Sort is an application designed, using a javax.Swing GUI, to produce an array of shapes and sort them by their surface areas.

The shape types, colors, and sizes are randomized each time the "Load Shapes" button is clicked.
The shapes are displayed in a descending diagonal based on their x-axis and y-axis.
